# Word Creator (ElectronJS Application)

![](https://github.com/CarlRiley99/WordCreator/blob/master/WordCreator.JPG)

## Concepts I learned
- How to Use ElectronJS to create a cross-platform desktop application
- Main and Renderer process in Electron and how they communicate with each other through ipc (Inter Process Communication)
- ElectronJS uses google's chromium engine (the same engine for their web browser Google Chrome). It is notorious for consuming a lot of memory. ElectronJS applications suffer the same consequence.
- How to drag objects using HTML/JavaScript
- How to use tables in HTML

## Description
For my PTP Strategy internship, the software is made using ElectronJS. The supervisor for that group wanted me to learn ElectronJS and build an application for it to see if my capabilities in learning new technolgoies. This was the result.

This desktop application is a simple word creator made for a target audience for children. Users are able to drag and drop certain letters/letter groups and place them in the blank spaces above. The reset button just refreshes the entire page.

## Running the application
The file "wordcreator_project-win32-x64" contains the .exe file that would be distrubted to users. Note that this .exe file is only applicable to users with 64-bit windows.

If you would like to run the project download this repository, navigate to it using your command line, and run it by typing "npm start".
